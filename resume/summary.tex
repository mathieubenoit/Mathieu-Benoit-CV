Currently employed as senior scientist in the high-energy physics department of University of Geneva, managing the CMOS pixel sensor R\&D activities towards the development of radiation-hard monolithic pixel particle detectors with high spatial and timing resolution for use in High-Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. I supervise a team of electronic engineers, physicists and students towards the elaboration of CMOS sensor design and the characterization of the realized prototypes in laboratory and in high-energy particle beams.
